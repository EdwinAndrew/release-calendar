## Important Reminder

**The goal is to LEARN, not just to finish.**

This is a journey, not a race. Take your time and understand each concept. It's okay to spend extra time on difficult topics. It's okay to revisit earlier phases to refine your code. The best learning happens when you're comfortable and curious.

**You're building real skills that will serve you throughout your career!**

---

## Questions or Stuck?

When you get stuck:
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Google the error message
3. Check Stack Overflow
4. Review the relevant documentation
5. Take a break and come back fresh
6. Ask for help in online communities

Remember: Every developer gets stuck. It's part of the process!
